# Debug Context Analysis Instructions

I'm providing you with a debug_context.md file that contains TypeScript/React errors. The format follows this structure:

## Format Structure:
- **File paths** are indicated with `###` followed by the file path
- **Error locations** are marked with "red line" followed by the problematic code element in quotes
- **Code context** is shown with "in:" followed by the relevant code snippet
- **Error messages** are prefixed with "error log:" 

## Your Task:
Please analyze this debug context and for each error:

1. **Identify the root cause** - What's actually causing the error?
2. **Explain the issue** - Why is TypeScript/React complaining?
3. **Provide solutions** - Give me concrete fixes with code examples
4. **Note any patterns** - If multiple errors stem from the same underlying issue, group them

## Reading Guide:
- When you see "red line 'X' in:", the error is specifically on the element X
- Multiple "red line" entries under the same file may be related
- "red line starts from X until Y" means the error spans multiple lines
- Code snippets show the surrounding context of where the error occurs

Please analyze the following debug context:
